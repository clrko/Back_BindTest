**Thunder** is a responsive musical quiz web application in which the user will test his current musical knowledge by guessing the artist name of the song being played. The frontend part enables any user to play the game either on a specific musical genre or in a cross-genre mode.

The backend has been developed in order to create a more personalised user experience by enabling the user to store his favorite songs and his scores.

* Creation and management of user accounts
* Ability to store the tracks in the user favorite list (user account required)

## Technologies (Backend specific)

## Potential improvements (backend specific)

* Security to be increased for the registration and password management
* Refactor and optimized the code to reduce the number of requests from the frontend
